Consider the discrete-time control system with a proportional controller K as shown in the following figure. The sampling period T is 0.1 second.

<ul>

 <li>Determine the pulse transfer function of the closed-loop system.</li>

 <li>Determine the range of gain K for stability of the closed-loop system.</li>

 <li>When K=1, draw Bode diagram of the open loop system in the w-plane by using any available method.</li>

 <li>Design the controller gain K so that the phase margin of the digital control system is 50<sup>o </sup>. With this value of K, determine the gain margin.</li>

</ul>
